                I went to Charles P. Allen Highschool in Bedford. Notable Classes I took include 
                Computer Programming 12, Physics 12 and Calculus. I graduated in 2022 with high honours.

            <p>
                While I do have lots of interests I do think my future is in Computer Science 
                which is why I decided to take the BCS program at Dalhousie University. 
                I hope to learn a lot about Computer Science so I can become the greatest 
                programmer in the multiverse and a zillionaire.

                That was enough talk about Computer Science and boring school info 
                so now I'm just going to rank a few of my favourite things since it would be fun 
                and you can learn about my interests.
