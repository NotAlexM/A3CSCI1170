            <p class="p1"> 
                During my highschool computer programming class I created a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense" target="_blank">tower defense</a></em> game called
                Turtle Tower Tefense Twenty Twenty Two (TTTTTT). It was coded it python and I used the 
                turtle graphics library which is why the game uses turtles, I used the built in shapes 
                since I didn't know how relative filepaths worked and I wanted it to work on any computer.</p>

            <p class="p2">
                If you are familiar with tower defense games this might look similar to another game known
                as <em>Bloons TD 6</em> (BTD6), which would make sense since that is what I based my game off of.
                This game is mostly a showcase of my understanding of python than it is an original game
                since this was my final project for a highschool programming class. That being said it's 
                not like my game is a complete rip off of BTD6. My game contains 5 different turtles types:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul1">
                <li><strong>Gun Turtle</strong> is the most basic turtle and can damage one enemy at a time</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Turtle</strong> is a turtle that has an attack that damages all enemies around it</li>
                <li><strong>Lava Turtle</strong> is a turtle that attacks by leaving a pool of lave on the track</li>
                <li><strong>Money Turtle</strong> is a turtle that can generate money for the player</li>
                <li><strong>Supaturtle</strong> is the strongest turtle and is can attack extremely quickly</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p3">
                Every turtle has 4 different upgrades that can increase their utility in defending against
                the enemies, it can get quite chaotic later on in the game when there is a lot going on
                and it doesn't help that turtle graphics is not the ideal game engine to use.

                Even if recently I've been pretty occupied with school and work I used to make a lot of<br>
                songs/beats on FL Studio. I started producing in the summer of 2020 (I was 15) and I <br>
                continued to produce throughout highschool. After highschool I a sort of "producer's block"<br>
                and I haven't made much music since then. Here's a dubstep song I made:

            <p class="p2">
                This is my most recent music project and if you are familiar with music production you'd 
                probably say that was pretty simple and I would have to agree, I don't have a lot of patience 
                when it comes to making music and I'd much rather finish a project quickly and move onto something 
                else then spend a lot of time on one big project, it might be to my own detrement but I just 
                like to experiment and make a lot of different things.

                One song I made was for a YouTube video which was a satirical take on the online trend to compare 
                the abilities of two different characters (usually fictional) by awarding points for different stats 
                to determine which character is more powerful. This is usually accompanied by an over the top <em>Phonk</em> 
                song. The video itself is a comparison of my friends and we rigged the stats to make our friend (who 
                would usually be considered weaker) win. The video isn't that funny if you don't know the people 
                in it or the online trend that it is a satire of. I made a phonk song for this video, the vocal sample 
                is a friend of mine rapping and the video itself was edited by another friend of mine, here it is:
